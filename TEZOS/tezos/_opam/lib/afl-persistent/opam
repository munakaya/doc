"afl-persistent is installed, but since the current OCaml compiler does
not enable AFL instrumentation by default, most packages will not be
instrumented and fuzzing with afl-fuzz may not be effective.

To globally enable AFL instrumentation, use an OCaml switch such as
4.04.0+afl." {success & afl-available & !afl-always}
