synopsis: "A pretty-printing combinator library and rendering engine."
description: """
This library offers a set of combinators for building so-called "documents" as
well as an efficient engine for converting documents to a textual, fixed-width
format. The engine takes care of indentation and line breaks, while respecting
the constraints imposed by the structure of the document and by the text width."""
