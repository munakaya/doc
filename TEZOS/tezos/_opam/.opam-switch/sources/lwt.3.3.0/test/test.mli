(** Helpers for tests. *)

type test
(** Type of a test *)

type suite
(** Type of a suite of tests *)

val test_direct : string -> ?only_if:(unit -> bool) -> (unit -> bool) -> test
(** Defines a test. [run] must returns [true] if the test succeeded
    and [false] otherwise. [only_if] is used to conditionally skip the
    test. *)

val test : string -> ?only_if:(unit -> bool) -> (unit -> bool Lwt.t) -> test
(** Like [test_direct], but defines a test which runs a thread. *)

val suite : string -> ?only_if:(unit -> bool) -> test list -> suite
(** Defines a suite of tests *)

val run : string -> suite list -> unit
(** Run all the given tests and exit the program with an exit code
    of [0] if all tests succeeded and with [1] otherwise. *)
