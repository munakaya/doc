join/bind (v2?)

command line interface:
  - afl-fuzz mode
  - quickcheck mode
  - random fuzzing mode (for me testing, really)
  - file / file list mode
  - reproduction mode (seed / file)
  - select which tests to run

output:
  - seeds for failed tests
  - maybe use notty to figure out pretty-printing width

api:
  - manual testsuite interface?
