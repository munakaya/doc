Another implementation of hash tables
=====================================

This implementation is based on 4 arrays instead of lists.
It performs in general:
- much faster than Hashtbl for puts
- much faster than Hashtbl for gets with float keys
- slower but close to Hashtbl for get with non-float keys
(see hashtbl.pdf)

Space usage is on average the same, although when the Hashtbl is
empty, the tables are allocated but empty...
