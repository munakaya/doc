\section{Introduction}

{\tt ocp-autoconf} is a tool to populate automatically various files for
an OCaml project.

\noindent
{\tt ocp-autoconf} uses two main configuration files:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ocp-autoconf.config}: the configuration file containing the
  description of the current project;
\item {\tt \$HOME/.ocp/autoconf/ocp-autoconf.conf}: a configuration
  file containing user-specific options;
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\tt ocp-autoconf} uses additionnal files in the {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/}
directory:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/configure.ac}: this file is included inside
  the {\tt autoconf/configure.ac} file generated by {\tt ocp-autoconf}.
\item {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/configure.ac}: this file is included inside
  the {\tt Makefile} file generated by {\tt ocp-autoconf}.
\item {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/build.ocp-inc}: this file is inserted inside
  the {\tt build.ocp} file generated by {\tt ocp-autoconf}. Since it is
  inserted, you must call {\tt ocp-autoconf} if you modify it.
\item {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/build.ocp2-inc}: this file is included inside
  the {\tt build.ocp2} file generated by {\tt ocp-autoconf}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\tt ocp-autoconf} generates the following files:
directory:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt configure} and {\tt autoconf/} directory for the GNU {\tt
  autoconf} tool. It uses options from {\tt ocp-autoconf.config} and
  {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/configure.ac};
\item {\tt .gitignore}: this file is automatically generated, and contains
  the user provided file {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/gitignore};
\item {\tt opam} and {\tt push-opam.sh}. {\tt push-opam.sh} is a script that
  creates a local branch in your local opam repository (specified in the
  {\tt \$HOME/.ocp/autoconf/ocp-autoconf.conf} file) to automatically push
  a new version of the package (using the {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/descr}
  and {\tt ocp-autoconf.d/findlib} files);
\item {\tt autoconf/generated.files}: this file is automatically generated, it
  contains the md5sum of all the files generated by
  {\tt ocp-autoconf}. It helps {\tt ocp-autoconf} to track changes done
  by the user to prevent accidentally overriding them.
\end{itemize}
